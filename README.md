# music-diff

**music-diff** is an application that tries to make a musical diff of two encoded music files. It is based on the VideApp-<sub>Arr</sub> from Beethovens Werkstatt. The actual comparison is done by a set of XSLTs, which is hosted by and used from the MEI-Garage.

At this point, only encoding with an equal number of measures can be compared.
